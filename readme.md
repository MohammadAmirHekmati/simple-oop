# Simple Object Oriented Programming

## Abstraction
``` Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. ```

## Encapsulation
``` Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class, and restricting access to some of the objectâ€™s components. ```

## Inheritance
``` Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse. ```

## Polymorphysm 
``` Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is often achieved through method overriding. ```
